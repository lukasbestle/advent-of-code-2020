# Advent of Code 2020

> Solutions for the [Advent of Code puzzles for 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## Design goals

My main goals for the puzzle solutions are the opposite of code golf:

- The code should be human-readable and as easy to follow as possible.
- I want to dogfood [Kirby](https://getkirby.com) where it makes sense.
- The code should work very reliably. I don't want to use hacks. This also means that the code isn't optimized in any way and also likely not very efficient.

## How to run the code locally

1. Download your inputs from the Advent of Code site and place them into files at `inputs/day.txt` (e.g. `inputs/1.txt`).
2. Then:

```
composer install

php 1.php
php 2.php
...
```
